The design principle behind EmulatorsTrainer.jl is that it will contain only functions independent of the specific emulators to be trained. There will be no CAMB, CLASS, pybird, velocileptors dependencies. This is an intentional choice: the user will have to write its own functions to compute the ground-truth.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In order to use the dataset creation feature, you need to write a function that computes your observables and stores it locally.
